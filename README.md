## gdnsd-geoip-testdata

This repo contains compressed GeoIP-related testsuite data files for the [gdnsd](https://github.com/gdnsd/gdnsd) project, which uses it as a git submodule.  The filenames are timestamped with the date they were retrieved.  They're not intended to be up to date; they're intended to be stable data to write testsuite code against.  These files don't change often (if ever); they're split to a separate repo here to avoid putting large binary blobs in the main project git repo.
